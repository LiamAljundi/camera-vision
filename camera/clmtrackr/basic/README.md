# clmtrackr basic

Uses [clmtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) to track a face. Tracked data is rendered to the canvas for experimenting.

See [the live demo on Glitch](https://ix-camera-clmtrackr-basic.glitch.me/) or [fork it](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/ix-camera-clmtrackr-basic).

# Bundles
