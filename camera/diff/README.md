# camera-diff

This demo compares pixels of the latest frame with a reference frame. By doing so, we can see what has changed from one point in time to another.

It builds off the 'pixels' example.

# Things to try

* Can you make a smarter logic to determine whether pixels are the same as a reference frame?
* How could you make a faux-bluescreen effect, separating objects from the background?
* Can you identify the region (in pixels) that contain movement? Eg a primitive intrusion detection system
* Could you make movement in certain regions trigger particular actions?
