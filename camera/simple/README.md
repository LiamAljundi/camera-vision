1. stream video from a camera to a `VIDEO` element,
2. grab frames from the stream and draw them to the canvas, and
3. capturing frames to new IMG element.

# Things to try

* Can images be recorded periodically to the canvas or as new elements?
* Can the multiple image elements be positioned or animated in an interesting way?
* Can you make another button to toggle the camera on and off?
* Can the `captureToCanvas` function be modified to draw the image differently? The canvas supports a variety of drawing modes and filters, for example.
